# Strategy: Context Loading

> **Rationale and adopter guidance:** [Sessions & Context](https://andrewrcr.github.io/arc-framework/reference/sessions/)
> on the docs site covers the instruction density concept, tier rationale, and scaling guidance.

Operational specification for how context is delivered to agents during ARC sessions — the tiered
model that controls what an agent knows at each point, and the loading mechanisms that deliver it.
For context preservation across sessions, see [Session Management Strategy][session-mgmt]. For
session lifecycle procedures, see [session-init][session-init] and
[session-handoff][session-handoff].

## The Three-Tier Model

ARC organizes agent context into three tiers based on when the content becomes relevant:

| Tier | Name           | When Loaded                          | Content Type                                              |
|------|----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| T1   | Constitutional | Session initialization               | Principles, identity, constraints, navigation             |
| T2   | State          | Session initialization               | Work status, session notes, task overview                 |
| T3   | Procedural     | On-demand at workflow trigger points | Method defaults/overrides, strategies, detailed workflows |

**T1 — Constitutional.** Content that governs all agent behavior regardless of the session's
work. Always loaded at session start.

- AGENT-BRIEFING.ARC.md (ARC framework orientation)
- AGENT-BRIEFING.PROJECT.md (project identity and collaboration context)
- Agent-specific file (operational guidance)
- DEV-RULES — ARC and Project (quality standards, methodology rules)
- STRATEGY-INDEX — both framework and project (navigation to domain guidance)
- QUICK-REFERENCE (environment context, command patterns)
- arc-config.yml (project settings)

**T2 — State.** Content that orients the agent — where work stands, what happened last session,
what comes next. Always loaded at session start.

- WORK-STATUS.md (branch, task list, next task, blockers)
- SESSION-NOTES.md (personal session context from prior handoff)
- Task list overview and current task section (strategic partial read)

**T3 — Procedural.** Step-by-step guidance for specific activities that may or may not happen in
a given session. Loaded on-demand when the agent enters the relevant workflow phase.

- arc-methods defaults and overrides (decision trees, format specs, classification rubrics)
- Strategy documents (domain-specific patterns and guidance)
- Workflow documents (prepare-commits, integrate-work-unit)
- arc-extensions steps (post-task-quality, pre-merge-review, etc.)

### State-Conditional Promotion

Some T3 content becomes near-certain to be needed based on session state available at init time.
Content meeting these criteria promotes from T3 to the session-init load set:

| Content           | State Signal                                     | Promotes When             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| process-task-loop | `Following Task List: Yes` + Next Task populated | Active task work expected |

Sessions without active task lists (planning, evaluation, exploratory) don't need ~240 lines of
dense procedural content. The state signal loads it precisely when relevant.

---

## Classification Criteria

When adding new content to ARC — strategy docs, method overrides, extensions, workflow
guidance — classify it by asking:

**T1 — Constitutional?**

- Would violating this without knowing it cause incorrect behavior across *any* session activity?
- Is this a constraint, principle, or navigation index that applies regardless of task type?
- Would deferring this create a risk of the agent acting contrary to project standards?

**T2 — State?**

- Does the agent need this to orient itself — to know where work stands and what comes next?
- Is this anchored to the current moment (branch, task, blockers) rather than general guidance?

**T3 — Procedural?**

- Is this guidance for a specific activity that may or may not happen this session?
- Does it have a natural trigger point — a workflow step, a task marker, a domain entry?
- Could an agent work correctly without this until reaching the relevant activity?

**When uncertain, prefer T1.** The cost of loading unnecessary constitutional content is wasted
tokens; the cost of missing it is incorrect behavior.

## Loading Mechanisms

Each tier has established mechanisms for how content enters agent context:

### Session initialization (T1 + T2)

The [session-init workflow][session-init] prescribes upfront loading of constitutional and state
documents in a defined order. This is a bulk load — deterministic, ordered, and complete before
work begins. The load order (general → specific) ensures each document is understood in the
context of what came before.

### Workflow-embedded directives (T3)

Workflow documents contain explicit loading instructions for the methods and references they
depend on. When the agent reaches a workflow step that references a method or strategy, the
workflow tells it to load the relevant section.

Directives appear as a method dependencies block near the top of workflow documents:

> **Method dependencies (load on first reference):** [method-a], [method-b]. For each, check
> `.override` first; use `.default` if no override is configured.

This mechanism is deterministic (the workflow prescribes it), automatic (the agent follows the
workflow step by step), and scoped (only the relevant methods load, only when needed).

### Strategy-index triggers (T3)

DEV-RULES instructs agents to check the [Strategy Index][strategy-index] before working in
codified domains. The index serves as a T1 navigation layer (always loaded) that points to T3
strategy content (loaded on-demand). Each entry includes "Consult when:" triggers so agents can
determine relevance without loading the full document.

### User-invocable skills (T3)

Skills (arc-resume, arc-commit, arc-handoff) are user-initiated triggers that load thin guidance
layers and reference T3 workflows. These cover session lifecycle events where the user explicitly
initiates the activity.

---

## Method and Extension Loading

### arc-methods.md

Session initialization scans arc-methods.md for override *presence* only — which methods have
active overrides. The agent does not read `.default` or `.override` content at init. It produces
a brief index: "Methods with overrides: [list]" or "all methods at defaults."

Method content loads on-demand when the agent reaches a workflow step that references the method.

**Method classification by trigger:**

| Method                | Trigger Workflow    | Session Applicability                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| issue-triage          | process-task-loop   | Universal — every task execution session   |
| quality-gate-commands | process-task-loop   | Universal — every task execution session   |
| test-first            | process-task-loop   | Conditional — tasks with test-first marker |
| commit-format         | prepare-commits     | User-triggered commit events               |
| commit-context-format | prepare-commits     | User-triggered commit events               |
| pre-merge-review      | integrate-work-unit | Integration phase only                     |
| review-triage         | integrate-work-unit | Integration phase only                     |
| session-state         | session-handoff     | Session end only                           |

### arc-extensions.md

Extensions are architecturally on-demand — workflows check their specific extension section at
the fire point, not at session init. The process-task-loop checks `post-task-quality` after task
completion; the integrate-work-unit workflow checks `pre-merge-review` before merging.
