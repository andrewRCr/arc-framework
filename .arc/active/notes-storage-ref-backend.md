## Prior art

One external pass on 2026-10-10, three facets, from fetched sources without further verification. Claims marked
_unverified_ rest on the researchers' memory; check them before a decision rests on them.

- **State tokens.** CouchDB's clustered `_changes` sequence encodes every shard's position and replays on a stale
  `since`, so its consumers stay idempotent. Cosmos DB continuation tokens and MongoDB resume tokens die with the log
  behind them, as etcd's compacted revisions do. etcd's revision and Datomic's `t` need one writer. A Flink checkpoint
  and a `jj` view record every source's position as one object; Dolt's root hash names the whole store but needs every
  writer to move one root (_unverified_); reftable's `update_index` is local to one repository (_unverified_ that it
  never transfers).
- **Record versions.** Kubernetes' `resourceVersion` changes on every modification, `generation` only with desired
  state. Cloud Storage's `metageneration` moves with metadata and resets with each `generation`, and its documentation
  pairs a metageneration precondition with a generation one. S3's ETag reflects contents only; Azure's moves on any
  write, metadata included (_unverified_ for the ETag itself). CouchDB's `_rev` hashes the body with its predecessor
  (_unverified_).
- **Git refs as a database.** git-bug — one ref per entity, refspecs in memory, operations ordered by Lamport clock, a
  disposable excerpt cache. Gerrit NoteDb — compare-and-swap as the only atomic operation, `BatchRefUpdate`, sequence
  blocks, and a restartable one-time migration. git-annex — a private index and union merge. `jj` — `refs/jj/keep/*`
  pins against garbage collection.
- **Sync and lifecycle idioms** (from memory, _unverified_): Fossil's `sync` runs a pull and a push, as editors' "Sync
  Changes" does, while Git, Dolt, and git-bug name the two directions `pull` and `push`; jj marks a bookmark that moved
  on both sides conflicted after a fetch; CouchDB deletes by writing a `_deleted` revision; Gerrit deletes refs through
  `BatchRefUpdate` with an expected old id and numbers changes on its server; offline-first stores replace a temporary
  ID at sync; retries back off exponentially with jitter. Git's refspec rule — no update but a fast-forward without
  `+` — and `--force-with-lease` are its documented behavior.
- **Remote designation:** `git remote rename` and `git remote remove` were tested on Git 2.55 in a scratch repository;
  Git's own per-remote keys are read from `git help -c`; the `gh-resolved` key was found in the `gh` binary;
  git-annex's per-remote `annex-*` keys are from memory, _unverified_.
- **Sources:** kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts; the Kubernetes API conventions
  (github.com/kubernetes/community, `api-conventions.md`); docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata and
  …/request-preconditions; docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Object.html and

  `architecture.md`; Gerrit commits `577e8fc66c`, `66ea2ed46e`, `05eaefe36d`, `029d2568393f`, and its `note-db.html`;

## Probes behind the design

Scratch probes on Git 2.55 (2026-10-10), beyond the figures the spec cites.

- **Torn reads.** A writer moved `refs/arc/work/a` and `refs/arc/project/inbox` together in one `update-ref --stdin`
  transaction while a reader listed both with one `for-each-ref` and counted listings that disagreed. The files format
  tore with one pattern, `refs/arc/`, in 24 of 11,288 listings and with two in 659 of 11,263; reftable tore in none of
  11,303 with one pattern, none of 11,015 with one pattern and `--exclude=refs/arc/history/`, and 81 of 11,221 with
  two, since `for-each-ref` reads one snapshot per pattern.
- **A long-lived reader sees later objects.** A `cat-file --batch-check` started before them found loose objects
  written later, newly packed ones, and every object after `gc` had replaced each pack (Linux). This is the question a
  long-lived reader would raise if a measured command ever calls for one.
- **Delta-search names.** Git's default pack name hash reads a path's last sixteen characters, and its opt-in second
  version mixes in the path's directories (`pack_name_hash` and `pack_name_hash_v2` in `pack-objects.h`). So a person's
  fixed-name files hash alike across people: `andrew/WORKING-MEMORY.md` exactly, `andrew/USER-INBOX.md` but for the
  id's last two letters. The pack-cost measurement compares today's names with names ending in the person's id.

## The first model check

An exhaustive breadth-first search (2026-10-10) over one work item's states on two and three machines and a remote —
writes, writes to the completed item, archive, abandon, reopen, pull, push, and a mirror push that deletes every state
ref or only the history ref — checking that the remote never holds the item live and ended, ended twice, or live beside
its end record, that no write is lost, and that repeated pulls and pushes settle. A ref's value is its set of commits,
ancestry a subset and a merge a union, so it checks the rules, not Git.

The rules as first written failed four ways, each now a rule and an integration case:

- an unleased live-ref push recreating a ref another machine's end deleted;
- two clones each reopening and ending an item between pushes, which publish only history-ref updates, so no live ref
  prunes;
- a clone's own end folded into another machine's published reopen;
- a history-ref create that lost to a restored ref, never fetched by name, so the push loop spun to its deadline.

With those rules, two machines explore clean in full and three clean to 1.5 million states. After a mirror push,
machines restore differing copies: a stale ancestor read as divergence until the ancestry rule took it as a loss, a
stale copy with its own pushes still diverges, and two ends both published read as two. No case lost a write.

## CI cost history

The in-repo conformance run took about 34 s on the retired self-hosted pool, where `storage-contract`'s 59 integration
files added about 131 s to every full run, the integration job rising from about 354 s to 495 s. The ref fixture's
budget is measured afresh on GitHub-hosted runners, against the in-repo conformance's time on the same runner.

## A designation per scope

Where personal state publishes stays with the backend; a designation per scope is a deferred follow-on, never
precluded. The principled form: the project's remote is the project's call, and the person's — the code remote by
default, a remote of their own, or none — is theirs. How private it can be is the hard part. Kept in the code
repository's refs, personal refs share a transaction with project refs — starting an Errand from a personal inbox entry
is one batch across both — but a mirror push still publishes them; moved to a separate Git directory, they are private
by construction, and that batch spans two directories that cannot commit atomically. The backend composes its push set
by scope, so the designation lands additively. The follow-on likely belongs beside `config-storage-architecture`, which
owns user-scope configuration; its tripwire is a person asking to keep personal state off a shared remote.
