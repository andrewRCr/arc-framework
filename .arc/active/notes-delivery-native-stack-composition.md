## Comparator vs plan-semantics fingerprinting

The contribution-proof comparator (`contribution-proof.ts` / `git-contribution-proof.ts`) and the plan-semantics
fingerprinting in `fingerprint.ts` are distinct concepts and must not conflate: the comparator proves content
equivalence of a carried member across predecessor movement; the fingerprint identifies plan-member semantics
across revisions. The arbiter swap replaces the former's fallback only — `fingerprint.ts` is untouched.

## Guard-test digest history

`delivery-terminal-workflow.test.ts` once pinned a whole-file sha256 over the workflow document. It was removed
because it froze a shared document (any unrelated edit broke the pin) and its reconstruction literal had gone
stale. That failure is the rationale behind the replacement-guard rule: structural assertions over the specific
contract (presence, uniqueness, ordering), never a digest over a shared document.

## Consumed `integration-boundary-accuracy` substrate

The design consumes the landed typed substrate rather than minting parallel reads: `arc review change-request
resolve` (member pull-request resolution / reverse lookup), `arc review status`, `arc base merge`,
`arc review merge-method resolve`, and the provider-neutral bounded wait — a stack-merge-API await is that wait's
natural third instantiation.
